# Jailer Database Tool

Jailer is a tool for database subsetting and relational data browsing. 

 - The Subsetter exports consistent, referentially intact row-sets from relational databases,
   generates topologically sorted SQL-DML, DbUnit datasets and hierarchically structured XML.
 - The Data Browser allows bidirectional navigation through the database 
   by following foreign-key-based or user-defined relationships.

## Features

 - Exports consistent and referentially intact row-sets from your productive database
   and imports the data into your development and test environment.
 - Improves database performance by removing and archiving obsolete data without violating integrity.
 - Generates topologically sorted SQL-DML, hierarchically structured XML and DbUnit datasets.
 - Data Browsing. Navigate bidirectionally through the database by following foreign-key-based or user-defined relationships.
 - SQL Console with code completion, syntax highlighting and database metadata visualization.

## Prerequisites

 - Java JRE 7 (or above)
   Important: due to HiDPI graphics support, Java JRE 11 (or above) is strongly recommended.
 - JDBC-driver for your RDBMS

## News

 - 2019-02-01   The new "Model Migration Tool" allows you to easily find and edit the newly added associations if the data model has been extended after the last change to this extraction model.
 - 2018-04-26   The new feature "Analyze SQL" analyzes SQL statements and proposes association definitions. This allows to reverse-engineer the data model based on existing SQL queries.
 - 2018-03-06   SQL Console with code completion, syntax highlighting and database metadata visualization.
 - 2017-05-10   New API provides programmatic access to the data export and import functionality. http://jailer.sourceforge.net/api.html
 - 2017-03-30 	Improved filter management. Support for import-filters and literal-filters.
 - 2017-01-27 	Referential cycles can now be exported by deferring the insert of nullable foreign keys.
 - 2016-21-10 	Filter Templates allows you to define rules for assigning filters to columns.Filters on primary key columns will automatically be propagated to the corresponding foreign key columns.

 - 2016-09-08 	New "Export To" mode allows to export rows directly into a different schema in the same database.
 - 2015-12-04 	Support for oracle's ROWID pseudo-column.
 - 2015-10-23 	Release 5.0 introduces the ability to collect rows in a separate embedded database. This allows it to export data from read-only databases.
 - 2011-07-20 	Implemented the "Subset by Example" feature: Use the Data Browser to collect all the rows to be extracted and let Jailer create a model for that subset.
 - 2010-04-15 	A Data Browser has been introduced. Navigate bidirectionally through the database by following foreign-key-based or user-defined relationships.
 - 2008-12-23 	Jailer now supports the DbUnit flat XML dataset file format, thus allowing the users of the famous JUnit extension DbUnit to use the extracted data for unit testing.
 - 2007-12-05 	Version 2.0 comes with new graphical user interface.
 - 2007-06-05 	Tutorial for Jailer now available.
